{{< callout context="note" title="Reminder" icon="info-circle" >}}  
It's my first post written in English here.  
I'm not using English as a native, so some expressions might be wrong.. please understand
{{< /callout >}}

Before beginning, thank you for some reactions with my activities including [Nakshatra Saxena][ref1], I was quite surprised because I started it very silently and just started to make collections.

As a some kind of response with gratefulness, I want to tell my personal opinion that why I use [Peerlist][plist]. Note that my thought might be away from many user's thought who started Peerlist, but it'll be okay because everyone would be mesmerized on Peerlist with different reason based on their experience and some other environments.

As I know, Peerlist is a job platform and social community for people in tech, especially including developers.
**But actually with my case, it’s pretty hard that Peerlist acts as a job platform or something related.** I'm from South Korea, even [Linkedin][linked] is absolute minority as a platform in here because koreans usually find a job mainly on domestic platform. International platforms including Linkedin & Peerlist are used for only few who wants to make a job from abroad.  
I don’t want to say that I’m completely closed on offering from other countries, but I think it requires more experience and some courage for me now..😅

So the reason why I’m using Peerlist is mainly based on the second option. I’m just a junior developer running up to 3 years, and I didn't majored in Computer Science either. I’m also quite shy and introverted so I still have some hesitations to open my experience or knowledge. I’ve tried but finally quit some platforms or communities because I felt some “heavy pressure” from them.

By contrast, Peerlist gave me the options to start from small sharings & posts. This may sounds not very interesting to someone but it’s very huge merit on me. **It makes me confortable and inspiring to use the service without pressure and feel like I’m making my personal archive, not a portfolio, resume or report.** Of course I'm definitely open with trending tech stacks and try to level up myself, but on the other side I always eager to develop and stack knowledge naturally and slowly. In this perspective, Peerlist is very suitable for my goals because it provides diversity and freedom to advance myself with community.

Except for this major reason, there are still many advantages with Peerlist like beautiful UI design, many interesting features and so on. Recently I'm feeling very satisfied with [custom domain][ref2] options. I won’t say long in this post because it takes too long.  
As I've searched over the internet, I easily found some demand with new development society (especially alternative for Linkedin). I also arrived on Peerlist while I was trying to find services like Linkedin too. I have no doubt that Peerlist will satisfy this demand and become more bigger if Peerlist team struggles like now.

I think I got excited by myself for a while😅, so I'll return and remain as a silent supporter for Peerlist. I'm always interested in productive communication related to IT industry, so you can always contact me if you have any opinion.

P.S. As I mentioned on the first I didn't intend to write this blog in English at first, so I think most people viewing this post cannot find more information of me here😅 See you on Peerlist instead! 🚀
